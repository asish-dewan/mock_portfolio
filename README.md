# Mock Portfolio

This is a source code for my personal mock portfolio website.

## What is the purpose?

To build a functioning web application (portfolio page) using just HTML and CSS.

This source code can be used as a starting point to showcase your developer skills with the ultimate goal of building a portfolio that highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it.
